# Avy-Assistant
This project was part of my Human Computer Interaction class. It's a smartphone assistant app named Avy!

The whole project's course was recorded on a Wordpress Website which was running on a VM given to us. You can find the site backup in the "Avy Backup" folder. 
The idea was conceived by our team, the website was mostly made and run by me, while the mockups and wireframes were made by my teammates and I.
A lot of elements of the app could be better but time was of the essence so we stuck with functionality over beauty!
